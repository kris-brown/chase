# 'the chase' implementation

This contains implementations of some papers on the chase. I'll attempt to summarize the what and why of the chase below.

## Background

Connected with relational databases that you might be more familiar with is the concept of *relational algebra*. What we called tables are now called *relations*, which we can think of as sets of tuples of some fixed length. We can use first order logic to express constraints.

| John  |  John |
| John | Mary   |
### Manage
|  name| manager |
|------|--------|
| Matt | John   |
| John |  John |
| Mary | John   |

To say that "`Name` is a primary key of `Manage`

$a^2 = b^2$
