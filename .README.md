# 'the chase' implementation

This contains implementations of some papers on the chase. I'll attempt to summarize the what and why of the chase below.

## Background

Connected with relational databases that you might be more familiar with is the concept of *relational algebra*. What we called tables are now called *relations*, which we can think of as sets of tuples of some fixed length. We can use first order logic to express constraints.

### Likes
| liker| likee |
|------|--------|
| Matt | John   |
| John  |  John |
| John | Mary   |
### Manage
|  name| manager |
|------|--------|
| Matt | John   |
| John |  John |
| Mary | John   |

We can express that "`Name` is a primary key of `Manage` by $\forall x$. We can express that `likee` is a foreign key $Likes \rightarrow Manage$

$a^2 = b^2$


\begin{tikzpicture}
\newcounter{density}
\setcounter{density}{20}
    \def\couleur{red}
    \path[coordinate] (0,0)  coordinate(A)
                ++( 60:6cm) coordinate(B)
                ++(-60:6cm) coordinate(C);
    \draw[fill=\couleur!\thedensity] (A) -- (B) -- (C) -- cycle;
    \foreach \x in {1,...,15}{%
        \pgfmathsetcounter{density}{\thedensity+10}
        \setcounter{density}{\thedensity}
        \path[coordinate] coordinate(X) at (A){};
        \path[coordinate] (A) -- (B) coordinate[pos=.15](A)
                            -- (C) coordinate[pos=.15](B)
                            -- (X) coordinate[pos=.15](C);
        \draw[fill=\couleur!\thedensity] (A)--(B)--(C)--cycle;
    }
\end{tikzpicture}
